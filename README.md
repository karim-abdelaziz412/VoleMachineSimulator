# üñ•Ô∏è Vole Machine Simulator  
Welcome to the **Vole Machine Simulator** repository! This project is a C++ implementation of a virtual machine designed for educational purposes. It demonstrates fundamental computer architecture concepts by simulating a custom machine capable of executing programs with support for arithmetic, memory management, register operations, and floating-point processing.

## üìã Project Objectives  
- Simulate a virtual machine to illustrate low-level programming concepts.  
- Provide hands-on learning with memory management, register operations, and instruction execution.  
- Demonstrate the implementation of arithmetic and floating-point operations.  
- Encourage modular code design and collaboration using GitHub.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
- **Program Loading**: Executes programs from files.  
- **Memory Management**: Implements memory allocation and access for instructions.  
- **Register Operations**: Handles register-based computation.  
- **Floating-Point Processing**: Includes operations with floating-point numbers.  
- **Modular Design**: Organized header files and source code for extensibility.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  
The repository is organized into the following files and directories:  
- **`headerFiles/`**: Contains the implementation and header files for various components:  
  - **`ALU.cpp` / `ALU.h`**: Implements the Arithmetic Logic Unit, responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations.  
  - **`CPU.cpp` / `CPU.h`**: Handles the central processing unit operations, including instruction execution.  
  - **`CU.cpp` / `CU.h`**: Implements the Control Unit, managing the flow of instructions and data within the simulator.  
  - **`Machine.cpp` / `Machine.h`**: Defines the main virtual machine, integrating all components.  
  - **`Memory.cpp` / `Memory.h`**: Manages memory allocation and access for the simulator.  
  - **`Register.cpp` / `Register.h`**: Implements register operations, used for intermediate computations.  
- **`main.cpp`**: The entry point of the program, which initializes and runs the simulator.
